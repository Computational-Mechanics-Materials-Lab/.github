Located in the Michael W. Hall School of Mechanical Engineering at Mississippi State University, the Computational Mechanics & Materials Laboratory (CMML) performs computational and experimental research related to additive manufacturing, mechanical deformation of metallic systems, and more! 

Our research focus stems from a desire to produce end-user knowledge and tools to advance the use of sophisticated computational frameworks and materials understanding for a wider audience. Please visit our [website](https://cmml.me.msstate.edu/) for more information.
